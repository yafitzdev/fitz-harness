/**
 * Deliberation gate — the full Standard catalog stays visible and callable
 * (the session looks and feels completely normal), but the FIRST tool call
 * of a turn is denied with an anchor directive when the turn has not yet
 * shown enough reasoning.
 *
 * This is the engine behind `deliberation-gate` — a trajectory-depth gate
 * built on the observable layer (the harness adapters expose no logprobs):
 * durable `assistant/chunk` events carry every reasoning/text delta of the
 * live trajectory, and their accumulated length per turn is a cheap, robust
 * deliberation-depth proxy for the collapse a callable catalog causes —
 * pre-action reasoning shrinks to a fraction of its no-tools depth. When
 * the proxy says "shallow", the gate denies once with a planning directive
 * (a push-back while tools stay live — the intervention shape that both
 * prompts deeper reasoning and keeps tool calls working); the retry then
 * carries the forced deliberation in-history.
 *
 * Behavior:
 *  - `session/event` accumulates `text-delta`/`reasoning-delta` lengths per
 *    (session, turn) from `assistant/chunk` records (the durable log keeps
 *    every chunk; wire telemetry drops most of them). Tool-call deltas carry
 *    no `.text` but still open the turn's entry, so the counter is live by
 *    the time a call dispatches.
 *  - A resumed session (no in-process chunk state) is cold-scanned from its
 *    durable log on first dispatch, so restarts keep the same depth.
 *  - `tools/pre-execute` checks the CURRENT turn's accumulated depth before
 *    dispatch: at or above `minChars` (default 400, tunable) the call
 *    proceeds untouched; below it, the call is denied
 *    with `gateText` (a planning prompt, phrased so it never reads as a tool
 *    failure) at most `maxGatesPerTurn` times (default 1) — the retry then
 *    carries the forced deliberation in-history.
 *  - A turn with no streamed text at all reads as depth zero and gates
 *    exactly once — failing safe toward MORE deliberation, never silence.
 *
 * Robustness:
 *  - The gate decision is fully synchronous up to the deny (no `await`
 *    before the counters mutate), so parallel tool calls cannot race past
 *    the budget.
 *  - Subagents default to ungated (their briefs are already plans); set
 *    `includeSubagents: true` to gate them too.
 *  - Executions without an agent (service-owned calls) pass untouched.
 *  - Per-session turn maps are pruned to the last few turns, so long
 *    sessions do not accumulate state.
